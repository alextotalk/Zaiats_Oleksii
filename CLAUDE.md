# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Self-Updating Instructions

After each session where code changes are made:
1. **Analyze the changes made** - review what was added, modified, or removed
2. **Update this CLAUDE.md file** - add new commands, architectural insights, or patterns discovered
3. **Document new dependencies** - record any new libraries, frameworks, or tools introduced
4. **Update development commands** - add any new build, test, or deployment scripts discovered or created

## Project Status

This repository is currently empty/new and contains only IDE configuration files. The project structure and development commands will need to be established as code is added.

## Development Commands

*To be populated as the project develops*

## Architecture Overview

*To be populated as the codebase grows*

## Development Setup

When code is added to this repository, ensure to:

1. **Initialize version control**: Run `git init` to set up version control
2. **Define project type**: Add appropriate configuration files (package.json for Node.js, pyproject.toml for Python, etc.)
3. **Set up development commands**: Configure build, test, and lint scripts in the appropriate configuration files

## IDE Configuration

The repository includes IntelliJ IDEA/PyCharm configuration in the `.idea` directory, suggesting this project may be developed using JetBrains IDEs.

## Dependencies and Libraries

*To be populated as dependencies are added*

## Testing Framework

*To be populated when tests are added*

## Build and Deployment

*To be populated when build processes are established*

## Next Steps for Development

When starting development in this repository:
- Determine the primary programming language and framework
- Set up package management and dependency files
- Configure testing framework and build tools
- Add appropriate .gitignore for the chosen technology stack
- Define coding standards and linting rules
